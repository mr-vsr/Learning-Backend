# Learning-Backend

### This is the repo where I'll be keeping all my codes and project which I'll be going through and building while learning backend web development.  
Feel free to refer the repo and contact me if you need any help.
#### Let's collaborate and learn together.

## After cloning the repo run the command ``` npm install ``` inside the respective projects folder.
### To run a particular project refer the ***package.json*** file and look for the command and then run that specific command. For example ``` npm run dev ``` is the command to run the ***videotube*** project.
